    "### **Summary**\n",
    "This showcase is intended to demonstrate the aplicability of telemetry to the Capacity Analysis process through the use of RESTSense. Capacity Analysis encompasses the analysis of capacity, a complex metric derived as a consequence of the interaction of microservices architectures (MSAs) with external services that establish rate limitations. These rate limitations forces the MSA to be aware of them, and for instance, this MSAs are refered to as Limitation-Aware Microservice Architectures (LAMAs). Thus, in order to evaluate the ability of RESTSense to provide valuable insights into the analysis process, we have prepared a test architecture that consists of a set of microservices (MSA) that are deployed using docker-compose. These services interact with external APIs, such as GitHub, converting this MSA into a LAMA. The TestBed is composed of the following three microservices, developped based on the [Generic API Requester](https://github.com/alesancor1/api-requester) project. Results show that RESTSense is able to successfully infer the inputs required for the capacity analysis based on the telemetry data, and thus, contributes to the automation of the capacity analysis process."

    "### **1. Introduction**\n",
    "This notebooks serves as an introduction to capacity analysis and telemetry integration using RESTSense. In this section, we will provide an overview of the purpose and scope of this showcase, highlighting the significance of telemetry in the capacity analysis process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Capacity analysis involves assessing the capabilities and limitations of a system, particularly in the context of microservices architectures (MSAs) interacting with external services. These interactions often introduce rate limitations that MSAs must take into account, which converts the MSAs into Limitation-Aware Microservice Architectures (LAMAs). Understanding and optimizing capacity is crucial for ensuring the smooth functioning and optimal performance of these systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate the evaluation of RESTSense's effectiveness in providing valuable insights for capacity analysis, we have prepared a test architecture consisting of a set of microservices (MSAs) deployed using docker-compose. These services interact with external APIs, such as GitHub, transforming our MSA into a LAMA. By leveraging RESTSense, we aim to automate the capacity analysis process and enhance our understanding of system behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the subsequent sections, we will present specific objectives of this showcase and explore the TestBed, which comprises three microservices developed based on the [Generic API Requester](https://github.com/alesancor1/api-requester) project. Furthermore, we will present the results obtained from applying RESTSense to infer the necessary inputs for capacity analysis based on the telemetry data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1.1 Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this showcase is to demonstrate the applicability of telemetry to the capacity analysis process. To this end, we will leverage RESTSense to infer the inputs required for capacity analysis based on the telemetry data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1.2 TestBed**\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, the Testbed consists of three microservices developed based on the Generic API Requester project. The microservices interact with external APIs, such as GitHub, and are deployed using docker-compose. The following figure illustrates the TestBed architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"./testbed/architecture.png\" alt=\"TestBed\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "<figcaption><i>Fig.1 - Architecture of the Testbed</i></figcaption>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture has been built thanks to the flexibility of the Generic API Requester, which allows to easily create new microservices by simply deploying a new docker container and sending the desired requests to make in JSON format. This way, it is possible to model multiple architectures with different topologies and interactions with external APIs.\n",

    "### **2. Data Extraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data extraction process is performed in two primary steps: data loading and preprocessing. The data loading step consists of loading the data from the database into a pandas dataframe. The preprocessing step consists of cleaning the data and extracting the relevant information from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The is reported by the [RESTSense Agent](https://github.com/restsense/agent) and collected by [RESTSense Collector](https://github.com/restsense/collector), then parsed and stored in a MongoDB database afterwards. Once stored, the data is extracted from the database into a CSV file using the [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) tool. CSV files can be found in the `data` directory."

    "In this section, we will perform the capacity analysis process using the topology inferred in the previous section. The capacity analysis process consists of two primary steps: LAMA creation and analysis. The LAMA creation step consists of creating a LAMA based on the topology inferred in the previous section. The analysis step consists of analyzing the LAMA to obtain the capacity of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of analysis is based on [this paper](https://biblioteca.sistedes.es/submissions/descargas/2022/JCIS/2022-JCIS-032.pdf) from Fresno-Aranda et al. where they use a tool called Smart-Lama to perform capacity abalysis. Thus, before starting, we will define some helper constants and functions that will be used throughout the capacity analysis process."

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we have demonstrated the applicability of telemetry to the capacity analysis process. To this end, we have leveraged RESTSense to infer the inputs required for capacity analysis based on the telemetry data. This contributes to the automation of the capacity analysis process and enhances our understanding of system behavior. Furthermore, the use of RESTSense in combination with Smart-Lama allows us to perform capacity analysis at runtime and in a continuous manner, which is crucial for ensuring the smooth functioning and optimal performance of these systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "RESTSense brings us one step closer to the automation of the capacity analysis process, and due to it exporting valuable telemetry data, may have potential applications in other areas. The usage of RESTSense telemetry data for machine learning purposes is feasible, and may be used to predict the capacity of the system, or to detect anomalies in the system behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we have successfully demonstrated the applicability of telemetry to the capacity analysis process, we have also identified some limitations, which are left as future work. These limitations include the need to manually enter the plans from external APIs, the inability to identify external services when the infrastructure is distributed over several servers with different network identifiers, and the need of infrastructure to deploy the RESTSense Collector, which may require additional resources from the system where it is deployed, leading to a potential increase of the infrastructure costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "These limitations could be addressed by extending the functionality of RESTSense. For instance, the plans from external APIs could be automatically obtained by leveraging RESTSense to extract the information from APIs that provide this information by means of standards and specifications such as [SLA4OAI](https://sla4oai.specs.governify.io/). Furthermore, RESTSense could implement agents for different languages other than Node.js, which would allow to identify external services when the infrastructure is distributed over several servers with different network identifiers. Finally, although the RESTSense datamodel specification is designed to input minimum overhead, the infrastructure costs may be affected anyway. This could be solved by providing a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution, where the RESTSense Collector is deployed in the cloud, thus reducing the infrastructure costs of monitored systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, RESTSense is a promising tool that can be used to automate the capacity analysis process and enhance our understanding of system behavior. Furthermore, RESTSense may have potential applications in other areas, such as machine learning."
